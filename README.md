## Hangman Game

A classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to losing, represented visually by drawing the hangman figure. The game includes a word bank, a responsive interface, and visual feedback for correct and incorrect guesses. Built for fun and to practice basic programming logic, conditionals, and user interaction.
